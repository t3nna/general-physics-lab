\section{Conclusion}

The emission wavelength is given at the start and is equal to 465.2[nm] so we do not have to look for its
value, as for the Planck constant we calculate it using our measurements and we obtain the value of
$6.66 \cdot 10^{-34}$ [J$\cdot$s] , we can see that our measurements are correct since the actual
value of the constant is  $6.62607015 \cdot 10^{-34}$ [J$\cdot$s] and we close enough to assume that our measurements and calculations are correct.
