\section{Conclusion}

In this experiment, we investigated Newton's rings and used it to determine the radius of curvature of a lens. By measuring the diameters of the interference rings and using the above formulas, we calculated the radius of curvature to be around 1.5 [m]. The accuracy of this measurement depends on the precision of our measurements of the interference ring diameters and the wavelength of the light. This experiment demonstrates the principles of interference in optics and provides a practical application for determining the properties of lenses.
