\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this experiment allowed us to determine the density of a solid sample using basic engineering tools and measurement techniques. Our results demonstrated the importance of accurate measurements and proper error analysis in scientific and engineering applications, as our calculations relied heavily on precise and reliable data. 

Through the use of a micrometer screw, calliper, and lab balances, we were able to measure the dimensions and weight of the sample with an appropriate level of uncertainty. This data allowed us to accurately calculate the volume and density of the sample. 

From our experiments we can conclude that micrometer screw is more precise because overall error is less while using this experiment.

Also density in our calculations equals approximately to 2.7 $g/cm^3$, using the table we can assume that material of the measured element was aluminium. 

Overall, this experiment provided valuable practical experience in using basic engineering tools and measurement techniques. We gained a deeper understanding of the importance of reliable measurements and appropriate error analysis in scientific and engineering applications, which will be beneficial for future experiments and projects.
