\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Theory}
 
Density can be measure using weight and volume. To calculate errors we can use two methods: direct and indirect.
\subsubsection*{Direct}

For direct measurements we can calculate: A, B, A + B uncertainties for diameter and mass. 


\subsubsection*{Indirect}


For Indirect measurements such as density and volume we can calculate uncertainties using parameters of the object and its weight. 



\subsection{Equipment}

The following devices were used during the laboratory:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Micrometer screw
	\item Calliper
	\item Lab Balances
	\item Measurement element
\end{itemize}
