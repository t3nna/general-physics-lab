\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Theory}
 
Density can be measure using weight and volume. To calculate errors we can use two methods: direct and indirect.
\subsubsection*{Direct}

For direct measurements we can calculate both: A and B uncertainties.



\subsubsection*{Indirect}

Resistance is measured indirectly using the ammeter-voltmeter method. Figures~\ref{fig:CVM},~\ref{fig:CCM} show different ways of implementing said method. In both instances, the resistance is calculated using the Ohm's law: $R=\frac{U}{I}$.  



The method error is calculated using the following formulas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CVM: $\Delta_m R = \frac{-R_m^2}{R_V - R_m}$, $\delta_m R = \frac{-R_m}{R_V}$;
	\item CCM: $\Delta_m R = R_A$, $\delta_m R = \frac{R_A}{R_m - R_A}$;
\end{itemize}

The CVM circuit should be used for small resistances and the CCM circuit should be used for big resistances. The following equation describes the threshold resistance for which the choice of the circuit doesn't matter: $R_{thr} = \sqrt{R_V\cdot R_A}$.


\subsection{Equipment}

The following devices were used during the laboratory:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Micrometer screw
	\item Calliper
	\item Lab Balances
	\item Measurement element
\end{itemize}
