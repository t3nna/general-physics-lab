\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our experiment aimed to verify Ohm's Law for alternating current and determine the inductance and capacitance of selected components. Using an RC circuit, we were able to determine the capacitance of the capacitor component. By measuring the inductance of the inductor component using an RL circuit, we were able to calculate the impedance of the RLC circuit and verify Ohm's Law for the alternating current. Our results demonstrate that Ohm's Law holds for AC circuits and that the measured capacitance and inductance values are consistent with the expected values. However, there were some sources of error in our measurements, such as uncertainties in the equipment and measurement process. Overall, the experiment was successful in achieving its objectives and provided a better understanding of the behavior of RLC circuits.
