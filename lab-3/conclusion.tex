\section{Conclusion}

In this physics lab, the aim was to study the external photoelectric effect. The experiment involved determining the I-V characteristic of a photovoltaic cell, measuring the spectral characteristic of the photocurrent, and finding the red limit of the photoelectric effect. The experimental setup consisted of a monochromator, an illuminator, a stabilized illuminator power supply, a photovoltaic cell power supply, a voltmeter, and a DC ammeter. The results were obtained by adjusting the wavelength using the monochromator, and the power output of the illuminator was varied to obtain different levels of illumination. The voltage and current output were recorded, and the values of the dark current were also measured. This experiment helped us understand the principles of the photoelectric effect and its applications in various fields. The results obtained provide valuable insights into the behavior of photovoltaic cells and their potential uses in energy generation.
