\section{Introduction}


The main goal of this experiment is to conduct a measurement of the resistivity of objects made of metal and semiconductor as a function of temperature and determine the temperature coefficient of resistivity of metals and the energy gap of semiconductor.
\subsection{Equipment}

The following tools were used during the laboratory:

\begin{itemize}
\item The chamber with the given objects and with a heating element and a ventilator 
\item Ohmmeter

\end{itemize}
