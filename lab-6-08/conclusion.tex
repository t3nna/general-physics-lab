\section{Conclusion}


Before starting the measurements, we examined the values of the given three balls. We measured the diameter for each ball, weighed each ball using an electric scale, and calculated the density of the liquid.

Based on the obtained measurements, we calculated the coefficient of viscosity for each ball. Using a stopwatch, we timed the duration for which the ball fell in a cylindrical vessel with the tested liquid. We used the formulas provided (given above).

In conclusion , the laboratory experiment on determining the viscosity of a fluid using Stokes' Law has provided valuable insights into the behavior of fluids and the motion of spherical bodies within a continuous medium. Through careful observation and analysis of the falling motion of various spherical bodies, we were able to understand the fluid's resistance and calculate its viscosity using Stokes' Law.
